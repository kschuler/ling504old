## Research Proposal

> **Deadline: April 16, 2019 (Specific Aims due Feb 19, 2019)**

For your end of semester project, you will write a research proposal following the guidelines of an NIH R03 application. From the NICHD website ([https://nichd.nih.gov](https://nichd.nih.gov)): “The small grant (R03) supports new research projects that can be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources.  They are awarded for up to two years and are not renewable.”  For more information about what an R03 is, I recommend [reading this article](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/research-project-grants) from the NIAID, which compares the R03 to a few other grant mechanisms.

Below are examples of real R03 grants provided by the NIH.  These examples are from fields much different than linguistics, but they should give you a general sense for how these grant proposals are structured.

* [Sample R03 #1](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/1r03ai111416-01_karplus_sample_app.pdf) (pages numbered 23-34)
* [Sample R03 #2](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/1r03ai111015-01_rappleye_full.pdf) (pages numbered 21-30)

### What to include
To clarify, you do not need to copy the format of a real R03 exactly.  For example, it is not necessary to provide a bio-sketch or a complete project budget.  Instead, we will focus on the research portion of the R03.  **Your proposal should include only the following elements**:

* [Title page (1 page)](#title-page)
* [Specific Aims (1 page)](#specific-aims)
* [Research Strategy (6 pages)](#research-strategy)
* [References (no limit)](#references)

#### Title Page
The title of your proposal, your name, and an abstract. 

#### Specific Aims
State concisely the goals of the proposed research and summarize the expected outcome(s), including the impact that the results of the proposed research will have on the research field(s) involved. List succinctly the specific objectives of the research proposed (e.g., to test a stated hypothesis, create a novel design, solve a specific problem, challenge an existing paradigm or clinical practice, address a critical barrier to progress in the field, or develop new technology).  [source: adapted from [official NIH instructions](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-d/research-forms-d.pdf)] 

#### Research Strategy
Organize the Research Strategy in the specified order and use the instructions provided below. Start each section with the appropriate heading – Significance, Innovation, Approach. [source: adapted from [official NIH instructions](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/how-to-apply-application-guide/forms-d/research-forms-d.pdf)]     
* **Significance:** Explain the importance of the problem or critical barrier to progress that the proposed project addresses. l Describe the scientific premise for the proposed project, including consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of published research or preliminary data crucial to the support of your application. l Explain how the proposed project will improve scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice in one or more broad fields.
* **Innovation:** Explain how the application challenges and seeks to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms. l Describe any novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation or interventions to be developed or used, and any advantage over existing methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions. l Explain any refinements, improvements, or new applications of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions.
* **Approach:** Describe the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses to be used to accomplish the specific aims of the project. Describe the experimental design and methods proposed  and how they will achieve robust and unbiased results. …include how the data will be collected, analyzed, and interpreted, as well as any resource sharing plans as appropriate.  Discuss potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success anticipated to achieve the aims.  If the project is in the early stages of development, describe any strategy to establish feasibility, and address the management of any high-risk aspects of the proposed work. Explain how relevant biological variables, such as sex, are factored into research designs and analyses for studies in vertebrate animals and humans. For example, strong justification from the scientific literature, preliminary data, or other relevant considerations, must be provided for applications proposing to study only one sex.

#### References

###  Formatting and topic restrictions
Your proposal must be **single-spaced** with at least **½-inch margins** and at least **11-pt font**.

Finally, there are no restrictions on the type of research project you propose – choose whatever topic interests you! - but you should keep in mind the feasibility constraints of the R03 mechanism.  R03’s support projects of **no more than two years** with total budgets of **no more than $100,000**.

## In-class peer review

### Written Critique

> **Deadline : April 26, 2019**

After handing in your completed proposal, your name will be removed (to keep it anonymous) and your proposal will be distributed to the other members of the class.  For each proposal, one person will be assigned to be primary reviewer and another to be secondary reviewer.  Primary and secondary reviewers will prepare written critiques that include:
*  **a brief summary of the proposal** (1-2 paragraphs)
* an evaluation of **the overall impact of the proposal** (1-2 paragraphs)
* and an **assessment of the strengths and weakness** (2-3 bullet points each) of the **Significance**, **Innovation**, and **Approach** of the proposal.

Primary and secondary reviewers should also use the NIH 9-point scale to assign scores to the **Overall Impact**, **Significance, Innovation,** and **Approach** of the proposal (with 1 being the highest score and 9 being the lowest).  To illustrate, the following is a sample critique (of sample R03 #2, above) provide by the NIH:

* [Sample critique](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/1r03ai111015-01_rappleye_ss.pdf)

### Mock-study section

In our last class, we will use these critiques to conduct a mock-study section.

## Written response to reviews
