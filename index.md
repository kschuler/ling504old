## Overview

### Course description
This course in an upper level undergraduate/graduate seminar in neurolinguistics. We will explore language in the brain through readings and discussions.

### Requirements
All students - including those auditing - are expected to play an active role in class discussion. In each class, one student will be assigned to be the primary reader of each paper.  The primary reader summarizes the reading, leads the discussion, and is primarily responsible for the assigned material.  However, everyone is required to read the assigned material and contribute to the class discussion.

If you are taking the course for credit, your final project will be a research proposal.  Your proposal will be reviewed in an in-class mock study section, and you'll be required to write a formal response to the reviews you receive.

### Evaluation

* **50% Participation in class discussion**: During class, you're expected to participate in class discussion, even if you are not the primary reader. Undergraduates are required to submit responses to the reading questions each week.

* **50% Papers**: You'll write two research analysis papers, each summarizing an article (of your choice) on language and the brain. These papers will be

## Resources

### Discussion question instructions

* Please post 5-8 discussion questions on [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/) by midnight on Monday before class. Your questions should reflect your understanding and thoughts on the assigned readings and will serve as the basis for our in-class discussion. These posting are meant to be very informal â€“ a simple list of questions will suffice, but a narrative style is fine, too, if you prefer that.  There are no formatting restrictions.
