<h3 align="center">Topic: Theories of the acquisition process</h3>

**Instructor**: [Kathryn Schuler](mailto:kschuler@sas.upenn.edu)  
3401-C Walnut Street, Office 314

**Time and place**: Tuesdays, 1:30-3:30pm   
Linguistics Department, Conference Room

## Overview

### Course description
In this seminar, we'll read and discuss classic and contemporary theories of the language acquisition process.  Topics include: prosodic, semantic, and syntactic bootstrapping theories, usage-based approaches, formal generative approaches, neural network models and more.  Each week we'll read a paper outlining a theoretical approach paired with either (1) an empirical investigation of the approach, (2) a paper expressing opposition to the approach, or (3) both. We'll discuss the strengths and weakness of both the theories and the empirical studies that investigate them. We'll also consider how one might design future experiments to test these theories.

### Requirements
All students - including those auditing - are expected to play an active role in class discussion. In each class, one student will be assigned to be the primary reader of each paper.  The primary reader summarizes the reading, leads the discussion, and is primarily responsible for the assigned material.  However, everyone is required to read the assigned material and contribute to the class discussion.

If you are taking the course for credit, your final project will be a research proposal.  Your proposal will be reviewed in an in-class mock study section, and you'll be required to write a formal response to the reviews you receive.

### Evaluation

* **20% Participation in class discussion**: Before each class, you'll post 5-8 discussion questions on the assigned readings.  During class, you're expected to participate in class discussion, even if you are not the primary reader.   

* **40% Research proposal**: You'll write a research proposal in which you propose a 1-2 experiments to test a theory of the acquisition process.  The proposal will follow the format of an NIH R03 application - 1 page for specific aims and 6 pages for the research plan.  More details about the proposal, including format, grading criteria, and samples, are available [here](spring2019/research-proposal).

* **20% In-class peer review**: On the final day of class, we'll conduct a mock study section - an NIH-style peer review panel - to evaluate the research proposals.   Each student will be asked to be the primary reviewer for one proposal and the secondary reviewer for another.  Primary and secondary reviewers will turn in written critiques of their assigned proposals and lead the discussion in the mock study section.  More details about the mock study section are available [here](spring2019/research-proposal#in-class-peer-review).


* **20% Written response to reviews**: After the in-class peer review, you'll receive the written reviews of your proposal and  be asked to write a formal response to the reviews’ critiques. More details about the response to reviews are available [here](spring2019/research-proposal#written-response-to-reviews).

## Resources

### Discussion question instructions

* Please post 5-8 discussion questions on [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/) by midnight on Monday before class. Your questions should reflect your understanding and thoughts on the assigned readings and will serve as the basis for our in-class discussion. These posting are meant to be very informal – a simple list of questions will suffice, but a narrative style is fine, too, if you prefer that.  There are no formatting restrictions.

### Research proposal instructions

* [Research proposal](spring2019/research-proposal.html)
* [In-class peer review](spring2019/research-proposal.html#in-class-peer-review)
* [Written response to reviews](spring2019/research-proposal.html#written-response-to-reviews)
